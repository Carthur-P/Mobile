## Paper - Mobile Application Development (BIT - IN721000)
This repo contains all the small projects developed during the Otago Polytechnic Bachelor of Information Technology mobile application development paper (IN721000). This paper is design to get us developing an application for Android phones using Java programming language. All the apps are developed in Android Studio. All of the small projects developed throughout the course was done to get us to use and become familiar with different mobile development concepts that were then used to developed our main project of our choice. My main project was 'Language Translator' which is an application used to translate text to 5 different languages with text-to-speech functionality. The link to this project can be found below.
